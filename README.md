# DiplomaProject

_The objective of this project is to develop a Web application that allows students to browse available
diploma thesis projects from various professors and apply for the diploma thesis projects that interest 
them. The application further allows professors to assign diploma thesis projects to students(via direct_assign or  three different random choices), supervise 
the assigned theses projects and assess the outcomes. The application also allows professors to have access to the archived subjects and theses_.
